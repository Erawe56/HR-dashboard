# HR-Dashboard

An HR Dashboard in Power BI is a visual representation of various HR metrics and key performance indicators that help HR professionals and managers track and analyze important aspects of workforce management. 

The Dashboard uses interactive visualizations like charts, graphs, and tables to allow users to explore data, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions related to human resource management. It helps HR departments optimize processes, improve employee engagement, and contribute strategically to organizational goals.
